# ‚úçÔ∏è StarCad - A basic 2D CAD drawing tool

---

Just a basic 'automatic desk'-inspired 2D cad 
drawing application. 

I typically only utilize the parametric drawing features
of a certain 2D CAD software. I had no interest in paying their
astonishing price for the desktop version and the (much cheaper) web version
is remarkably terrible. 

So I thought I'd do it myself.

### üì¶ Dependencies
 - [SDL](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL)
 - [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)
 - [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)

### üî® Building
The project uses [CPM](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake) for 
package management and CMake building. I use CLion so...I pretty much just 
have it setup for that (right now). 

1. Clone this project into CLion
2. CPM should automatically download all
dependancies and setup your build config. 
3. That's pretty much it.
